# Advent of Code

This repository contains different flavors of code for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge.

The package structure is copied from the marvelous work by [Marcel Blijleven](https://github.com/marcelblijleven) in [his own Advent of Code repository](https://github.com/marcelblijleven/adventofcode). Marcel, you implemented exactly what I had in mind... why reinvent the wheel?
